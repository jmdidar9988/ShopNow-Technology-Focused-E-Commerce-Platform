# ShopNow-Technology-Focused-E-Commerce-Platform
ShopNow is a technology-focused e-commerce web application that simulates a real-world online shopping experience. The platform allows users to browse, purchase, and manage technology products such as gadgets, accessories, and electronic devices. It is built using Flask for the backend and MySQL for the database, managed through XAMPP.

The system supports two main user roles: customers and administrators. Customers can browse products, manage shopping carts, place orders, and track purchases. Administrators can manage products, orders, and overall system operations through a dedicated admin dashboard. The project demonstrates secure authentication, normalized database design, and real-world e-commerce workflows.
